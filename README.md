# JS-vegatiton-cover-for-C.A.R.

## Context
For issuing the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR - Cadastro Ambiental Rural), it was necessary to collect vegetation polygons. In this way, a code was adapted to generate vegetation polygons in Google Earth Engine. This allowed generating vegetation data for the region of interest. The JavaScript code executes an AI that was trained using shapes previously manually created within the company. It produces an output shapefile containing the vegetation data for CAR.
